# Grammar-Check
A combination of a few available grammar check packages with a few additional checks. It uses one available grammar check packages, language_check and I have tried doing some string manipulation and regex to rectify a few more grammatical errors. 

The whole package is callable from an API which has been implemented using Flask.
